                <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>What is this?</b>
                    <br />
                    This is a way to improve your immersion in PTFS by
                    calculating your aircraft's performance capabilities before
                    takeoff and landing. If you have a long runway, you usually
                    do not require the entire runway to take off. Instead, you
                    can use a lower thrust setting. Alternatively, you can
                    depart from a holding point that is closer to your gate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What do the takeoff numbers mean?</b>
                    <br />
                    For takeoff, the calculation gives you four values. The
                    thrust setting is the minimum amount of thrust required to
                    depart safely. V<sub>1</sub> is the speed at which there is
                    no longer enough runway left to take off. V<sub>R</sub> is
                    the speed at which you should rotate the aircraft. In PTFS,
                    you will leave the ground at this speed. Finally, V<sub
                        >2</sub
                    >
                    is the speed which must be obtained by the end of the runway
                    (at a height of 35 ft) in order to climb during an engine
                    failure. In this calculator, it is assumed to be V<sub
                        >R</sub
                    >
                    + 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What do the landing numbers mean?</b>
                    <br />
                    For landing, the calculation gives you the actual landing
                    distance that you need, the LDR (which includes a safety
                    margin), and the LDA for the runway you selected. The margin
                    is simply the LDA minus the LDR. V<sub>REF</sub> is the
                    reference speed, which is the speed you should aim for on
                    touchdown. Your aircraft should never be below this speed
                    during final approach. In this calculator it is 23% above
                    your stall speed. aircraft. V<sub>APP</sub> is the approach
                    speed, which should be flown on final approach. In reality,
                    this depends on wind, but in this calculator it is simply
                    V<sub>REF</sub> + 5.
