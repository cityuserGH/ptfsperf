                <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>What is this?</b>
                    <br />
                    This is a way to improve your immersion in PTFS by
                    calculating your aircraft's performance capabilities before
                    takeoff and landing. If you have a long runway, you usually
                    do not require the entire runway to take off. Instead, you
                    can use a lower thrust setting. Alternatively, you can
                    depart from a holding point that is closer to your gate.
                    When landing, you probably don't need to use reverse thrust
                    at all. The PTFS Performance Calculator allows you to you
                    make sure that you have enough distance to land safely.

                    <b>What do the takeoff numbers mean?</b>
                    <br />
                    For takeoff, the calculation gives you four values. The
                    thrust setting is the amount of thrust required to depart
                    safely. V<sub>1</sub> is the highest speed at which you can
                    reject the takeoff. V<sub>R</sub> is the speed at which you
                    should rotate the aircraft. In PTFS, you will leave the
                    ground at this speed. Finally, V<sub>2</sub> is the speed
                    which must be obtained by the end of the runway (at a height
                    of 35 ft) in order to climb during an engine failure. In
                    this calculator, it is assumed to be V<sub>R</sub>
                    + 4 kts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What do the landing numbers mean?</b>
                    <br />
                    For landing, the calculation gives you the actual landing
                    distance that you need to stop the aircraft (including a
                    7-second flare), the landing distance required (LDR, which
                    includes a 15% safety margin), and the landing distance
                    available (LDA) for the runway you selected. The margin is
                    simply the LDA minus the LDR. V<sub>REF</sub> is the
                    reference speed, which is the speed you should aim for on
                    touchdown. The calculator assumes that you pass the runway
                    treshold at this speed. Your aircraft should never be below
                    this speed during final approach. In this calculator V<sub
                        >REF</sub
                    >
                    is 30% above your stall speed. aircraft. V<sub>APP</sub> is
                    the approach speed, which should be flown on final approach.
                    In reality, this depends on the headwind and other factors,
                    but in this calculator it is simply V<sub>REF</sub> + 5.
