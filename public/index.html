                <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>What is this?</b>
                    <br />
                    This is a way to improve your immersion in PTFS by
                    calculating your aircraft's performance capabilities before
                    takeoff and landing. If you have a long runway, you probably
                    don't need to utilize the full power of your aircraft. Save
                    fuel by reducing your takeoff thrust. You may even be able
                    to depart from a holding point that is closer to your gate.
                    Instead of eyeballing it and risking an overrun, this
                    calculator ensures you have enough distance to lift off - or
                    stop, if you reject the takeoff. When landing, reverse
                    thrust is usually unnecessary: this calculator lets you know
                    when, and even tells you the margin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What do the takeoff numbers mean?</b>
                    <br />
                    The calculator gives you the thrust setting that is required
                    to depart safely. V<sub>1</sub> is the highest speed at
                    which you can reduce the throttle to 0% and reject the
                    takeoff. The distance used for this is the accelerate-stop
                    distance. If you reject the takeoff after V<sub>1</sub>, you
                    may overrun the runway. V<sub>R</sub> is the speed at which
                    you should rotate the aircraft, leaving the ground. Finally,
                    V<sub>2</sub> is the speed which must be obtained by the end
                    of the runway (at a height of 35 ft) in order to climb
                    during an engine failure. In this calculator, it is assumed
                    to be V<sub>R</sub>
                    + 4 kts.

                    <b>What do the landing numbers mean?</b>
                    <br />
                    For landing, the calculation gives you the actual landing
                    distance that you need to stop the aircraft (including a
                    7-second flare). It also gives the landing distance required
                    , which includes a safety margin of 15%. The landing
                    distance available depends on the runway you selected. V<sub
                        >REF</sub
                    >
                    is the reference speed, which is the speed you should aim
                    for on touchdown. The calculator assumes that you pass the
                    runway treshold at this speed. Your aircraft should never be
                    below this speed during final approach. In this calculator,
                    V<sub>REF</sub> is 30% higher than your stall speed. V<sub
                        >APP</sub
                    >
                    is the approach speed, which should be flown on final
                    approach. In reality, this depends on the headwind and other
                    factors, but in this calculator it is simply V<sub>REF</sub>
                    + 5.

                    <b>Does it work?</b>
                    <br />
                    Yes! PTFS and Roblox physics are somewhat janky, so don't
                    expect miracles. In addition, we all fly a little
                    differently in PTFS. But every calculation makes realistic
                    assumptions based on experimentally recorded performance
                    data for the aircraft you are flying.
